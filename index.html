<p>This page presents my language Small that I created in the seventies as a
  portable language for systems and application programming that can be
  implemented by a full bootstrap. The process is based on macro processors.
  The first stage uses simcmp, a simple text processing algorithm that can be
  written, or translated by hand, into any available programming language or
  assembly language; then it is used to translate the source code for Stage 2
  into any available language or assembly code. Then this complete working
  version of Stage 2, with far more capable features than simcmp, is used to
  translate the Stage 2 source to assembly language with a number of
  optimizations applied to make Stage 2 an efficient, capable, general purpose
  macro processor. These portable software tools, simcmp and Stage 2 are
  components of MPS, the mobile programming system created by Professor
  Emeritus William Waite of the University of Colorado in the late sixties. </p>

<p>My language Small is built using Stage 2 as its bootstrap compiler. My
  Master of Science thesis, <i>Small: A Contribution to the Mobile Programming
  System</i>, is reproduced here as a reference manual.</p>

<p>Stage 2 is used in this presentation as a two pass compiler. The first pass
  uses a set of macros from my thesis to translate source code in Small to
  Mill, a machine independent low level language described in the thesis. Then
  Stage 2 is used with another set of macros to translate Mill to assembly
  language, in this case 32-bit x86 instructions for the yasm assembler. Thus
  with the implementation of Stage 2 presented here, and the Small to Mill
  translation macros, the only thing required to construct a new compiler is
  the set of macros to translate Mill to yet another assembly language. The
  example implementation serves to show how that can be accomplished. It is
  also possible to combine macros into a single set to make a one pass
  compiler. However I chose to present the two pass process for the sake of
  clarity.</p>
