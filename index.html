  </a>Welcome to my GitHub repositories</h3>

<p>This page presents my language called Small that I created in the seventies
  as a portable language for systems and application programming that can be
  implemented by a full bootstrap. The process is based on macro processors.
  The first stage uses simcmp, a simple text processing algorithm that can be
  written, or translated by hand, into any available programming language or
  assembly language; then it is used to translate the source code for Stage 2
  into any available language or assembly code. Next, this complete working
  version of Stage 2, with far more capable features than simcmp, is used to
  translate the Stage 2 source to assembly language with a number of
  optimizations applied to make Stage 2 an efficient, capable, general purpose
  macro processor. These portable software tools, simcmp and Stage 2 are
  components of MPS, the mobile programming system created by Professor
  Emeritus William Waite of the University of Colorado in the late
  sixties.</p>

<p>Small is built using Stage 2 as its bootstrap compiler. My
  Master of Science thesis, <I>Small: A Contribution to the Mobile Programming
  System</I>, is reproduced in the repository as a reference manual.</p>

<p>Stage 2 is used in this presentation as a two pass compiler. The first pass
  uses a set of macros from my thesis to translate source code in Small to
  Mill, a machine independent low level language described in the thesis. Then
  Stage 2 is used with another set of macros to translate Mill to assembly
  language, in this case 32-bit x86 instructions for the yasm assembler. Thus
  with the implementation of Stage 2 presented here, and the Small to Mill
  translation macros, the only thing required to construct a new compiler is
  the set of macros to translate Mill to yet another assembly language. The
  example implementation serves to show how that can be accomplished. It is
  also possible to combine macros into a single set to make a one pass
  compiler. However I chose to present the two pass process for the sake of
  clarity.</p>
<h2><a>The Repositories</a></h2>
<p>Each repository contains a README.txt file that describes the contents and
  how it can be used and what is needed. A makefile also shows how to build
  components. The LICENSE is the general public license, GPLv2, and applies
  to all files created by me and that contain my name or initials CRB.</p>

<h3><a>simcomp</a></h3>
<p>The Simple Compiler is a simple text substitution macro processor
  implemented here as a stand-alone C program based on the SIMCMP Fortran
  program of the MPS translated to C. The compiled executable is immediately
  usable on 32- and 64-bit Linux systems. The simcmp executable is used to
  create a first working version of the Stage 2 macro processor. There is also
  a subdirectory containing a port to ARMv6 for the Raspberry Pi.</p>
<h3><a>stage2-1</a></h3>
<p>This repository contains simcmp macros to translate the Stage 2 source code
  to 32-bit x86 assembly language for the yasm assembler. The source code for
  Stage 2 is embedded in the comments of the assembly code stream, but is not
  presented directly until we can get permission from Professor Waite. Again,
  the stage2 executable is immediately usable.</p>
<h3><a>stage2-2</a></h3>
<p>This repository contains the Stage 2 macros to translate the Stage 2 source
  code to x86 assembly language with many simple optimizations applied. The
  compiled executable, stg2, should be copied to your /usr/local/bin or
  wherever you keep local executable for further use. The optimized executable
  is smaller and faster than the stage2-1 implementation.</p>
<h3><a>small</a></h3>
<p>This repository presents the simple mobile algorithmic language using Stage
  2 as its compiler. The first pass uses the macros small.s2m to translate
  Small source code to Mill, a machine independent low level language. The
  second pass translates Mill to 32-bit x86 assembly language for the yasm
  assembler. A reproduction of my 1982 masters thesis serves as a reference
  manual for Small and Mill. Several example programs and tests are included
  in subdirectories along with makefiles. This is a work in progress and more
  examples will be forthcoming.<p>
<h3><a>grandios</a></h3>
<p>This repository contains a fully expanded I/O system written in C modeled
  on the F4IO Fortran I/O module in the MPS. The grandios I/O module is
  required for both Stage 2 implementations and is also currently used for
  Small programs. Up to nine channels can be attached to files using
  positional parameters on the command line. In addition channels 1, 3, and 4
  can default to stdin, stdout, and stderr respectively. Also channel 1 has
  been modified to revert to stdin when an input file reaches end-of-file. A
  smaller version to be called Demios targeted for Small programs is under
  construction.</p>
<h3><a>hexdmp</a></h3>
<p>This repository contains a C program to dump the contents of a file in
  hexadecimal and ASCII.</p>
